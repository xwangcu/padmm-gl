This code implements the graph learning framework described in:

X. Dong, D. Thanou, P. Frossard, P. Vandergheynst, "Learning Laplacian matrix in smooth graph signal representations," arXiv:1406.7842.

===acknowledgement===
We reuse some code in the SGWT toolbox, originally written by David Hammond, for a function in our implementation. We also use the CVX package for optimization.

===usage===
You need to have CVX (http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/, you can get a free academic license if you have an academic affiliation) and SWGT (http://wiki.epfl.ch/sgwt) toolboxes installed. Other toolboxes and functions are already included in the zip. Once you have everything in place, you should be able to simply run "main_gaussian_new.m‚Äù and get results for both algorithms described in the paper for a simple synthetic scenario.
